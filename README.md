## üèÉ Runing the server
Once cloned, create a python or conda virtual environment, install the dependencies in requirements.txt, and then follow the steps to launch the server :
1. Our repo is configured to work with PostGRES, so create a new PostGRES database, and copy the credentials in a .env file in the root directory of the repo like so:
```yaml
DB_NAME=devfest2k24_db
DB_USER=devfest2k24_db_user
DB_PASSWORD=aLOSZHBymFWYJVuZbRfP8G3TN6vA8M5X
DB_HOST=dpg-cs8lngt6l47c73djjmb0-a.frankfurt-postgres.render.com
DB_PORT=5432
PUSHER_INSTANCE_ID=81c0ae68-e069-4f61-b077-f32109ad8497
PUSHER_PRIMARY_KEY=0EC9A4DC914ACE1E725990007D9D90D7F6BF5B16E8C8EE8436A1D663A29D024F

PUSHER_APP_ID="1881989"
PUSHER_KEY="7d6ea766b63cf2c27687"
PUSHER_SECRET="22a589d1c0b7be4baff2"
PUSHER_CLUSTER="eu"
```
2. in the root folder run : python manage.py makemigrations
3. in the root folder run : python manage.py migrate
4. in the root folder launch a local development server with : python manage.py runserver
